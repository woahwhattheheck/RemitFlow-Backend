# RemitFlow Backend

Node.js + Express backend for **RemitFlow**, a Stellar-powered cross-border
remittance demo. It exposes a small REST API for FX quotes and transfers and
uses an in-memory store, so no database is required. Anything Stellar-related
is mocked.

## Tech stack

- Node.js + Express
- In-memory store (data is lost on restart)
- `cors`, `dotenv`, `morgan`, `uuid`

## Getting started

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env
npm start
```

The server listens on `PORT` (default `3000`).

## Configuration

The application is configured using environment variables (typically defined in a `.env` file). The following variables are supported:

| Variable | Description | Default |

| `DB_POOL_MIN` | Minimum database connections in pool | `2` |
| `DB_POOL_MAX` | Maximum database connections in pool | `10` |
| `DB_POOL_IDLE_TIMEOUT_MS` | How long a connection can be idle before being closed (ms) | `30000` |
| `DB_POOL_CONNECTION_TIMEOUT_MS` | Time to wait for a connection before timing out (ms) | `2000` |
| `CACHE_DEFAULT_POLICY` | Default cache policy for endpoints (`no-store`, `public`, `private`) | `no-store` |
| `CACHE_RATES_MAX_AGE_SECONDS` | Cache duration for rates endpoints (seconds) | `10` |
| `FX_CACHE_TTL_MS` | FX snapshot freshness window from the provider timestamp (ms) | `30000` |
| `FX_STALE_GRACE_MS` | Additional window for visibly stale display data (ms) | `60000` |
| `FX_QUOTE_TTL_MS` | Lifetime of an issued quote for transfer binding (ms) | `60000` |
| `FX_ALLOW_STALE_TRANSFERS` | Accept an explicitly bound stale quote only within FX grace and its quote lifetime; enabled only by `true` | `false` |
| `PAGINATION_DEFAULT_LIMIT` | Page size used when a request omits `limit` | `50` |
| `PAGINATION_MAX_LIMIT` | Largest accepted `limit`; bigger requests are rejected | `200` |
| `PAGINATION_MAX_SCAN` | Max records a single history query may examine | `10000` |
| `PAGINATION_CURSOR_SECRET` | HMAC key used to sign pagination cursors | *(random per process)* |
| `API_TOKENS` | JSON object mapping API tokens to their allowed scopes (see [Authentication](#authentication)) | *(demo tokens)* |


## Authentication

All write endpoints and most read endpoints require a valid **Bearer token** in
the `Authorization` header:

```
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

### Scopes

| Scope | Grants access to |
|-------|-----------------|
| `transfers:read` | `GET /api/transfers`, `GET /api/transfers/stats`, `GET /api/transfers/:id` |
| `transfers:write` | `POST /api/transfers`, `POST /api/transfers/:id/claim`, `POST /api/transfers/:id/cancel`, `POST /api/transfers/:id/archive`, `POST /api/transfers/:id/unarchive` |
| `users:read` | `GET /api/users`, `GET /api/users/:id` |
| `users:write` | `POST /api/users` |
| `audit:read` | `GET /api/audit` |

### Public endpoints (no token required)

`GET /api/health`, `GET /api/health/live`, `GET /api/health/ready`,
`GET /api/version`, `GET /api/rates`, `GET /api/rates/:pair`, `GET /api/quote`

### Configuring tokens

Set the `API_TOKENS` environment variable to a JSON object mapping token
strings to their scope arrays:

```bash
API_TOKENS='{"my-production-token":["transfers:read","transfers:write","users:read","users:write","audit:read"],"reporting-token":["transfers:read","audit:read"]}'
```

If `API_TOKENS` is not set, the server starts with three **demo tokens** (safe
for local development only — rotate before deploying):

| Demo token | Scopes |
|------------|--------|
| `test-token-admin` | all scopes |
| `test-token-readonly` | `transfers:read`, `users:read`, `audit:read` |
| `test-token-transfers` | `transfers:read`, `transfers:write` |

### Error responses

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `401 Unauthorized` | `Authorization` header is missing, malformed, or the token is not recognised |
| `403 Forbidden` | Token is valid but lacks the required scope for this endpoint |

## API overview

See the endpoint reference below. All responses are JSON. Errors use a
consistent envelope:

```json
{ "error": { "message": "...", "status": 400, "details": { }, "requestId": "...", "at": "..." } }
```

Every response carries an `X-Request-Id` header (echoed from the request when
supplied) so logs and errors can be correlated.

### Pagination

`GET /api/transfers` and `GET /api/audit` page with **opaque cursors**. A cursor
names a position in the collection rather than a row count, so pages stay
correct while records are being written.

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `limit` | Page size. Defaults to `PAGINATION_DEFAULT_LIMIT`; values above `PAGINATION_MAX_LIMIT` are **rejected with 400**, not clamped. |
| `order` | `asc` or `desc`. Transfers default to `asc`, audit entries to `desc`. |
| `cursor` | Opaque cursor from a previous response's `pageInfo`. |
| `offset` | Legacy, deprecated. Cannot be combined with `cursor`. |

Every response carries a `pageInfo` block:

```json
{
  "count": 50,
  "limit": 50,
  "order": "asc",
  "pageInfo": {
    "hasMore": true,
    "nextCursor": "eyJ2Ijox...",
    "endCursor": "eyJ2Ijox...",
    "scanned": 51,
    "scanTruncated": false
  },
  "transfers": []
}
```

- `nextCursor` — pass as `?cursor=` to fetch the next page; `null` on the last page.
- `endCursor` — the position this page ended at, present even on the last page.
  With `order=asc` a client can park here and poll for records appended later
  without re-reading anything.
- `scanned` / `scanTruncated` — how many records the query examined, and whether
  it stopped at `PAGINATION_MAX_SCAN` rather than at the end of the collection.
  A truncated page is still gap-free: follow `nextCursor` to continue.

To page a collection, walk it:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  "http://localhost:3000/api/transfers?limit=50"
# then, with pageInfo.nextCursor from the previous response:
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  "http://localhost:3000/api/transfers?limit=50&cursor=$CURSOR"
```

Cursors are signed and bound to the query that produced them. Reusing one
against a different filter set, a different sort order, or a different API
token is rejected rather than reinterpreted:

| Condition | Status | `details.code` |
|-----------|--------|----------------|
| Cursor presented with a different API token | `403` | `CURSOR_ACTOR_MISMATCH` |
| Filters changed mid-walk | `400` | `CURSOR_FILTER_MISMATCH` |
| Sort order changed mid-walk | `400` | `CURSOR_ORDER_MISMATCH` |
| Cursor edited, forged or truncated | `400` | `INVALID_CURSOR` |
| Cursor predates a store restart | `400` | `STALE_CURSOR` |
| `limit` above the maximum | `400` | `LIMIT_TOO_LARGE` |
| `offset` beyond `PAGINATION_MAX_SCAN` | `400` | `OFFSET_TOO_DEEP` |
| `cursor` and `offset` sent together | `400` | `CONFLICTING_PAGINATION` |

Cursors are signed with `PAGINATION_CURSOR_SECRET`. Without it a random key is
generated per process, which is fine for the in-memory store — cursors do not
outlive a restart anyway — but **set it explicitly before running more than one
instance behind a load balancer**, or cursors minted by one instance will be
rejected by another.

#### Deprecated: offset pagination

`?offset=` still works and still returns the original `total`/`offset` fields,
so existing clients keep working. It has two problems cursors fix:

- **Instability.** The offset window is defined by a row count, so a record
  inserted (or archived) while a client is paging shifts every later page: rows
  get repeated or skipped entirely.
- **Cost.** The server must walk every skipped record on each request, and
  `total` costs a full pass over the filtered collection. Offsets beyond
  `PAGINATION_MAX_SCAN` are refused for that reason.

Offset responses include `pageInfo.nextCursor` as well, so a client can start on
offsets and switch to cursors mid-walk.

### Caching and headers

The API implements Cache-Control response headers for security and efficiency:
- **Default policy**: All endpoints (such as transfers, users, quotes, and health check probes) are non-cacheable by default (`Cache-Control: no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate, proxy-revalidate`, `Pragma: no-cache`, `Expires: 0`).
- **Rates (`GET /api/rates`, `GET /api/rates/:pair`)**: Cached publicly with a short duration (default 10 seconds, configured via `CACHE_RATES_MAX_AGE_SECONDS`).
- **Version (`GET /api/version`)**: Cached publicly for 1 hour (`max-age=3600`).

## Endpoints

### Health

- `GET /api/health` — service health snapshot (version, uptime, env).
- `GET /api/health/live` — liveness probe.
- `GET /api/health/ready` — readiness probe with dependency checks.
- `GET /api/version` — service name and version.

### Rates & quotes

- `GET /api/rates` — list supported currencies and their USD rate.
- `GET /api/rates/:pair` — rate for one pair, e.g. `/api/rates/USD-INR`.
- `GET /api/quote?amount=&from=&to=` — FX quote with fee breakdown.

All `amount` fields (quotes and transfers) are guarded for numeric
precision: values must be finite, within a safe numeric range, and have
at most 2 decimal places (e.g. `100.129` is rejected with a 400). This
prevents floating-point/sub-cent precision loss from being silently
rounded away.

#### Quote freshness and binding

Rates and quotes expose `freshness`, including `status`, `stale`, `providerId`,
`fetchedAt`, `expiresAt`, and `ageMs`. Quotes also return `quoteId`,
`quoteVersion`, `stale`, `quoteCreatedAt`, and `quoteExpiresAt`. Show stale
data as stale; receiving a display quote does not guarantee transfer acceptance.

`FX_CACHE_TTL_MS` measures freshness from the provider's `fetchedAt`, not from
the most recent HTTP request. A successful fetch of an old snapshot does not
renew its timestamp. Staleness begins at `freshness.expiresAt`; the grace
window ends at that timestamp plus `FX_STALE_GRACE_MS`. The separate
`quoteExpiresAt` also limits transfer use. Neither the grace window nor the
quote lifetime includes its end timestamp.

| Request | Pricing behavior |
|---------|------------------|
| `GET /api/rates`, `GET /api/rates/:pair`, `GET /api/quote` | May return visibly stale data strictly within the FX grace window. |
| New transfer with `quoteId` | Binds the issued quote's original terms; amount and normalized currencies must match, and current freshness and quote expiry are checked again. |
| New transfer without `quoteId` | Intentionally mints and binds a fresh quote at creation. This supported compatibility path does not reuse an earlier displayed quote. |

To bind terms the sender has reviewed:

1. Request `GET /api/quote?amount=100&from=USD&to=INR` and retain its
   `quoteId`, price/fee breakdown, and expiry metadata.
2. Include that `quoteId` in the transfer body alongside the same amount,
   `from`, and `to`. Supply the normal Bearer token and `Idempotency-Key`.
   The response records `quoteId`, `quoteVersion`, `rateProvider`,
   `rateFetchedAt`, and `rateStale`.
3. If the request's outcome is unknown, retry the same key and body, including
   `quoteId`. A completed retry replays the stored transfer without requoting.
   `quoteId` is part of the idempotency fingerprint; changing it under a
   completed key is a different-payload conflict.
4. After `QUOTE_EXPIRED` or `QUOTE_STALE`, fetch and review a new quote before
   choosing new terms. Omitting `quoteId` deliberately selects fresh pricing
   instead of preserving the previously displayed terms.

With the default `FX_ALLOW_STALE_TRANSFERS=false`, stale FX is rejected for
transfer pricing. Setting it to exactly `true` permits an explicitly bound
stale quote only while both its FX grace window and quote lifetime remain
valid. The no-`quoteId` path still requires a fresh snapshot.

FX/quote failures use the normal `error.details.code` field:

| HTTP status | Code | Meaning |
|-------------|------|---------|
| `404` | `QUOTE_NOT_FOUND` | The supplied quote is not retained by this process; request a new quote. |
| `409` | `QUOTE_EXPIRED` | The quote lifetime has ended; request and review a new quote. |
| `409` | `QUOTE_STALE` | The bound snapshot is outside the configured transfer freshness policy. |
| `409` | `QUOTE_MISMATCH` | The transfer amount or currencies differ from the bound quote. |
| `503` | `FX_PROVIDERS_DOWN` | No provider/cache snapshot is usable under the requested policy. |
| `503` | `FX_REFRESH_IN_PROGRESS` | A refresh is already running and no cached snapshot is usable under the requested policy. |

These FX settings are read at startup; restart after changing them.
`CACHE_RATES_MAX_AGE_SECONDS` controls HTTP response caching and does not
extend FX freshness or a quote's lifetime. The built-in primary and fallback
providers wrap the same static demo rate table. Cache entries and quote IDs
are process-local, disappear on restart, and are not shared across replicas.
The bounded quote map can also evict an unexpired quote, so clients must handle
`QUOTE_NOT_FOUND` rather than assuming retention until `quoteExpiresAt`.

### Transfers

- `POST /api/transfers` — create a transfer.
  Body: `{ senderName, recipientName, amount, from, to }`
  Optional `quoteId` binds a previously issued quote; omission mints a fresh one
  (see [Quote freshness and binding](#quote-freshness-and-binding)).
  Requires an `Idempotency-Key` header (see below).
- `GET /api/transfers` — list transfers. Supports `?status=`, `?q=` (name
  search), `?archived=` (true/false/all), and [cursor pagination](#pagination)
  via `?cursor=`/`?limit=`/`?order=`. Archived transfers are excluded from
  results by default; the default order is `asc` (oldest first).
- `GET /api/transfers/stats` — aggregate counts and volume by currency.
- `GET /api/transfers/:id` — fetch one transfer.
- `POST /api/transfers/:id/claim` — recipient claims the transfer.
- `POST /api/transfers/:id/cancel` — sender cancels a pending transfer.
- `POST /api/transfers/:id/archive` — archive a transfer, hiding it from default list results.
- `POST /api/transfers/:id/unarchive` — unarchive a transfer, restoring it to default list results.

#### Idempotency

`POST /api/transfers` requires an `Idempotency-Key` header. The endpoint moves
money, so a client that omits the header is not opting out of protection, it is
unaware it needs it; the request is rejected with 400 rather than risking a
duplicate.

For a given (API token, key) pair the operation runs at most once:

- **Retry with the same payload** replays the stored transfer, answering 201
  with the original body. The quote is not recomputed, so a moved rate cannot
  change the answer, and no second payment is submitted.
- **Reuse with a different payload** answers 409. The fingerprint covers the
  fields that determine the transfer, so property order, an amount sent as a
  string, and unrelated extra fields all still count as the same request.
- **A retry arriving while the first is still in flight** answers 409 rather
  than starting a second settlement.
- **A provider failure releases the key**, so retrying with the same key can
  succeed once the provider recovers.

Keys are scoped to the API token: two callers using the same key get two
independent transfers, and neither can reach the other's.

Records live in the same store as the transfers, so with the in-memory store
that backs this demo a restart clears both together. That keeps them
consistent: a surviving reservation would replay a transfer that no longer
exists.

### Users

- `GET /api/users` — list users.
- `GET /api/users/:id` — fetch one user.
- `POST /api/users` — create a user. Body: `{ name, email, country? }`

## Transfer lifecycle

```
pending ──▶ claimed
   │
   └──────▶ cancelled
```

A transfer starts as `pending` and can move to either `claimed` or
`cancelled`. Terminal states cannot transition further.

**Archival:** Transfers can be archived independently of their lifecycle status.
Archived transfers are excluded from default list results but remain queryable
via `?archived=true`. Use `/api/transfers/:id/archive` to archive and
`/api/transfers/:id/unarchive` to restore a transfer.
